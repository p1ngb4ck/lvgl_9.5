# LVGL KAWAII FACE

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-0015%2Flvgl__kawaii__face-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/0015/lvgl_kawaii_face)

A kawaii-style animated face widget for [LVGL 9](https://lvgl.io/) on ESP32.  
Renders eyes, eyebrows, blush, and a mouth on LVGL canvases with per-emotion dynamic animations — bouncing, sparkling, pupil movement, tears, sweat drops, and smooth transitions between every expression.

## Emotions

| Constant | Expression |
|---|---|
| `FACE_NEUTRAL` | Resting face with idle glance and micro-smile cycle |
| `FACE_HAPPY` | Wide eyes, big smile, energetic bounce, cycling sparkles |
| `FACE_WORRIED` | Nervous smile, twitching raised eyebrows, anxious fidget |
| `FACE_SAD` | Droopy eyes, deep frown, falling tears, melancholy sway |
| `FACE_CRY` | Squinted eyes, sobbing tremor, animated tear streams |
| `FACE_SURPRISED` | Wide eyes, pulsing diamond/O mouth, shock vibration |
| `FACE_ANGRY` | Furrowed brows, rage-flush blush, jaw trembling |
| `FACE_SLEEPY` | Half-closed eyes, slow nod, lazy sweat drip |
| `FACE_WINK` | One eye closed, playful smile, cycling sparkles |
| `FACE_LOVE` | Heart-shaped eyes, heartbeat float, max blush |
| `FACE_PLAYFUL` | Wide grin, wagging tongue, energetic bounce |
| `FACE_SILLY` | Cross-eyed, darting pupils, goofy grin |
| `FACE_SMIRK` | Asymmetric brows, slow side-glance, subtle smirk |
| `FACE_WORKING_HARD` | Gritted teeth, focused gaze, dripping sweat |
| `FACE_EXCITED` | Rapidly darting pupils, huge grin, rapid bounce |
| `FACE_CONFUSED` | Asymmetric brows, Lissajous pupil orbit, head-tilt wobble |
| `FACE_COOL` | Half-lidded squint, slow deliberate glance |

## Adding to your project

Copy the `lvgl_kawaii_face/` folder into your project's `components/` directory.  
No other changes to your build files are needed — the component's `CMakeLists.txt` declares all dependencies.

```
my_project/
└── components/
    └── lvgl_kawaii_face/
        ├── CMakeLists.txt
        ├── idf_component.yml
        ├── lvgl_kawaii_face.c
        └── include/
            └── lvgl_kawaii_face.h
```

In any source file that uses it:

```c
#include "lvgl_kawaii_face.h"
```

---

## Usage

### 1. Create a parent panel

The face fills whatever parent object you give it. Size and position are set entirely on the parent — the face scales automatically.

```c
lvgl_port_lock(0);

lv_obj_t *face_panel = lv_obj_create(lv_scr_act());
lv_obj_set_size(face_panel, 135, 135);
lv_obj_align(face_panel, LV_ALIGN_CENTER, 0, 0);
lv_obj_set_style_bg_opa(face_panel, LV_OPA_TRANSP, 0);
lv_obj_set_style_border_width(face_panel, 0, 0);
lv_obj_set_style_pad_all(face_panel, 0, 0);
lv_obj_clear_flag(face_panel, LV_OBJ_FLAG_SCROLLABLE);

lvgl_port_unlock();
```

### 2. Initialise

```c
face_config_t cfg = {
    .parent          = face_panel,  // NULL → fills the active screen
    .animation_speed = 30,          // timer interval in ms (~33 FPS)
    .blink_interval  = 3000,        // auto-blink every 3 s
    .auto_blink      = true,
};
ESP_ERROR_CHECK(face_animation_init(&cfg));
```

### 3. Set an emotion

```c
// Instant switch
face_set_emotion(FACE_HAPPY, false);

// Smooth transition
face_set_emotion(FACE_SURPRISED, true);
```

### 4. Reposition

Move `face_panel` at any time — the face follows it:

```c
lvgl_port_lock(0);
lv_obj_set_pos(face_panel, new_x, new_y);
lvgl_port_unlock();
```

## Thread safety

On ESP-IDF, `esp_lvgl_port` lock/unlock is used automatically when the header is available.  
On any other platform — or when you manage your own LVGL task — call `face_set_lvgl_lock_fns()` **before** `face_animation_init()` to supply your own mutex pair.  
Pass `NULL` for both to restore the platform default.

---

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| ESP-IDF | ≥ 5.0 |
| LVGL | ≥ 9.0 |
| `esp_lvgl_port` | Optional (auto-detected at compile time) |
